    ensuring that trainers are allocated to the correct student batches
    based on course requirements and expertise.

**Trainer Module**

Trainers are responsible for handling students in their assigned batches
and facilitating learning through structured content delivery. Their
responsibilities include:

-   **Adding students to specific batches**: Trainers can manually add
    students to batches, ensuring that each batch is properly assigned
    and managed.

-   **Uploading and releasing PPTs dynamically**: Trainers can control
    when PPTs are released, allowing for scheduled learning progression.

-   **Assigning tasks and homework**: Trainers can provide assignments
    to students based on the learning material covered.

**2. Non-Functional Requirements**

Lernova must meet several non-functional requirements to ensure
usability, security, and performance.

-   **Performance**: The platform must have fast response times,
    ensuring that students and trainers do not experience lag when
    accessing materials or submitting assignments.

-   **Security**: Authentication and authorization are managed via Clerk
    to ensure secure login and access to user-specific data.

-   **Scalability**: The platform must be capable of handling an
    increasing number of users as more institutions and students join.

-   **Usability**: The UI must be intuitive and easy to navigate for
    students, trainers, and admins.Â 

-   **Availability**: With Firebase as the backend, high uptime and
    reliability are ensured, minimizing downtime and disruptions.

**3. Prototypes, Wireframes, and Journey Map**

-   **Prototypes**: Initial designs will provide a visual representation
    of how Lernova\'s UI will look and function.

-   **Wireframes**: These will outline the fundamental structure and
    layout of different pages.

-   **Journey Map**: A detailed step-by-step guide will illustrate how
    users interact with the platform, from login to course completion.

**4. UX Documentation**

-   **User Personas**: Each role (Admin, Trainer, Student) will have
    defined user personas with their needs and goals clearly documented.

-   **User Flows**: Diagrams will show how each user type moves through
    the platform.

-   **UI Guidelines**: Standardized design elements, color schemes, and
    typography to ensure consistency.

**5. Architecture Design**

Lernova is built on modern web technologies:

-   **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) is used for developing an
    interactive user interface.

    materials, and assignments.

-   **Authentication**: Clerk ensures role-based authentication and
    security.

-   **Storage**: Firebase Storage is used to manage course-related files
    like PPTs and assignments.
